Installation & Usage
=====================

Outline here how to install and use your project/code. For Python projects, this could include how to install the dependencies:

- Install project dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install < requirements.txt
  ```

Models
============

If your repository contains any model, please add one description block per model to your README (see example below). It will then automatically get added to the [Model Overview](https://gitlab.empa.ch/ues-lab/tools/model-overview-wiki/-/wikis/home). Clusters of models with the same type can be aggregated into one description block. If your repository does not contain any model, you must delete this section (incl. description block).
